# ChatPlugin
   
This AI project aims to create a **small, user-friendly plugin** that can be integrated into various chat software applications to **optimize user expression and enhance communication efficiency**. This is achieved by using large AI models to reduce disagreements due to miscommunication or misunderstanding.  
   
## Product Design   
  
The product is designed for two types of dialogue scenarios: **low and high-density information exchanges**.   
  
- In **low-density dialogues**, common on platforms like WeChat and QQ, the product underlines ambiguous or vague expressions to minimize user confusion.   
- In **high-density dialogues**, such as those on e-commerce or recruitment platforms, the product helps users express their thoughts clearly and concisely.  
   
## Unique Selling Proposition  
   
Despite the existence of applications with similar features, this project stands out due to its focus on **convenient use** and its ability to **adapt to different communication scenarios**. The product also offers solutions to common problems in AI-related applications, such as high learning costs and lack of user-friendly interfaces.  
   
## Target Customers  
   
- The **primary target customers** are platforms and applications that provide a dialogue scene for users, such as WeChat, Taobao, etc.   
- The **secondary target customers** are teams with frequent internal communication or certain data security needs.  
   
## Product Value  
   
The product's value lies in its **functionality, convenience, and ability to improve personal work efficiency**. It also aims to familiarize users with AI products and cultivate their habit of using AI applications, bringing value to the entire Internet ecosystem.   
  
## Future Plans
