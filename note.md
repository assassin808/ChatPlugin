- Design barriers: "I don't even know what I want the computer to do..."
- Selection barriers: "I know what I want the computer to do, but I don't know what to use..."
- Coordination barriers: "I know what things to use, but I don't know how to make them work together..."
- Use barriers: "I know what to use, but I don't know how to use it..."
- Understanding barriers: "I thought I knew how to use this, but it didn't do what I expected..."
- Information barriers: "I know why it didn't do what I expected, but I don't know how to check..."


In this case, we note that rather
than making the app interface try to act more human, there may
be useful design opportunities by making the app interface act
explicitly in non-human ways.
